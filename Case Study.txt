The column names are self-explanatory; feel free to make relevant assumptions. 
Each product could come in combination of multiple flavors. Each unique flavor used 
in a product is separated from another by a semicolon (;). 
E.g. Product ID #10 states: “Cherry, not specified; Vanilla, not specified.” This means 
product #10 comes in a combination of two unique flavors. The first flavor “Cherry, 
not specified” means the flavor is Cherry but it is not mentioned what particular type 
of Cherry flavor is used (e.g Red Cherry or Black Cherry). Similarly, for the second 
flavour. 
The “Launch date” represents the date on which a product was launched.
